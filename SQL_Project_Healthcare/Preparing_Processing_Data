-- 1. Removed irrelevant data for analysis

CREATE TABLE encounters_data AS
SELECT id, start, stop, patient, encounterclass, description, base_encounter_cost, total_claim_cost, payer_coverage
FROM public.encounters 
--> Organization, provider, payer, code and reasoncode columns were removed as they did not elucidate any information viable for analysis.

CREATE TABLE patients_data AS
SELECT id, birthdate, deathdate, prefix, first, last, race, ethnicity, gender, address, city, state, county, zip, healthcare_expenses, healthcare_coverage, income
FROM public.patients
--> Lat, lon, mrn, fips, ssn, suffix, drivers, passport columns were removed as they did not elucidate any information viable for analysis.

CREATE TABLE immunizations_data AS
SELECT date, patient, description
FROM public.immunizations
--> Encounter and code columns were removed as they did not elucidate any information viable for analysis.

CREATE TABLE conditions_data AS
SELECT start, stop, patient, description
FROM public.conditions
--> Encounter and code columns were removed as they did not elucidate any information viable for analysis.

-- 2. Checked the internal structure (i.e., data types) of new data frames

# Encounters
SELECT * 
FROM encounters_data
--> Timestamp data type columns ('Start' and 'Stop') were designated as 'date' and 'time' data types for further analysis of date/time.

# Patients
SELECT * 
FROM patients_data
--> No data types required cleansing.

# Immunizations
SELECT * 
FROM immunizations_data
--> The Timestamp data type column ('date') requires converting to 'date' and 'time' data types for further analysis of date/time.

# Conditions
SELECT * 
FROM conditions_data
--> No data types required cleansing. 

-- 3. Added columns separating date and time for further analysis

# Encounters 
ALTER TABLE encounters_data
ADD start_date DATE,
ADD start_time TIME,
ADD stop_date DATE,
ADD stop_time TIME

UPDATE encounters_data
SET start_date = CAST(start AS DATE)

UPDATE encounters_data
SET start_time = CAST(start AS TIME)

UPDATE encounters_data
SET stop_date = CAST(stop AS DATE)

UPDATE encounters_data
SET stop_time = CAST(stop AS TIME)

# Immunizations
SELECT *,
CAST(date AS DATE) as date,
CAST(date AS TIME) as time
FROM immunizations_data

-- 3. Checked for duplicates within datasets

SELECT id, COUNT(*)
FROM encounters_data
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

SELECT id, COUNT(*)
FROM patients_data
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

SELECT patient, COUNT(*)
FROM immunizations_data
GROUP BY patient
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

SELECT patient, COUNT(*)
FROM conditions_data
GROUP BY patient
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

--> No duplicates were present in the 'patient' or 'encounters' data frames.
--> Both the 'immunizations' and 'conditions' data frames had a range of patients who had encountered the hospital many times. 
--> However, no duplicates were removed, as each 'patient' had encountered the hospital for diverse immunizations and conditions. 
--> This was cross-checked with the DISTINCT function:

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM conditions_data

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM immunizations_data

-- 4. Checked null or blank values within data frames

# Encounters example:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM encounters_data
WHERE description IS NULL
--> 1,221 values were recognized as null within the encounters data frame across column 'description'. 
--> All other columns had 0 null values. 

# Patients:

--1. Checked the internal structure of tables--


--2. Checked for duplicates within datasets--

SELECT id, COUNT(*)
FROM public.encounters
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

SELECT id, COUNT(*)
FROM public.patients
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

SELECT patient, COUNT(*)
FROM public.immunizations
GROUP BY patient
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

SELECT patient, COUNT(*)
FROM public.conditions
GROUP BY patient
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

--> No duplicates were present in the 'patient' or 'encounters' data frames.
--> Both the 'immunizations' and 'conditions' data frames had a range of patients that had encountered the hospital many times. 
--> However, no duplicates were removed, as each 'patient' had encountered the hospital for diverse immunizations and conditions. 
--> This was cross-checked with the DISTINCT function:

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM public.conditions

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM public.immunizations

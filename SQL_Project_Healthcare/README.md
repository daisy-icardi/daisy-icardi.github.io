### Overview
This project analyzed healthcare data across patient conditions, encounters, and immunizations to uncover key trends and insights. The dataset spans a century of healthcare records, allowing for both temporal and categorical analyses.

### Data Understanding
The dataset used in this analysis is based on Synthea, an open-source synthetic healthcare data generator, which provides extensive records of healthcare encounters, conditions, and patient demographics (Click Here). The dataset includes millions of unique patient records and spans over a century of data. Notable features of the datasets include patient demographics, encounter details, conditions reported, and immunization history. Key findings from the patient data reveal that the average age of patients is 39.2 years, with the largest group being adults aged 27–39. The dataset also shows that middle-aged adults (ages 40–65) represent a significant proportion of patients, and older adults (over 65) follow closely behind. The most common patient sex in the dataset was female, comprising 100% of records. 

### Key Insights 
Key insights were derived from investigations into which types of encounter classes were most common and how hospital stays and ambulatory care visits varied over time. Additionally, we examined what the most frequent medical conditions were, particularly which ones were associated with the longest and shortest hospital stays. How did psychological stress-related conditions and pregnancy-related conditions vary across different age groups? We also explored the timing of seasonal flu vaccinations, particularly whether there were any delays in immunization trends related to the flu season, especially in regions like Massachusetts. These questions provided insights into healthcare behaviors and trends across various demographic and clinical factors.

#### Conditions Data Insights
The year 2020 recorded the highest number of reported conditions (10,448), driven by the pandemic, while 1914 and 1915 had the lowest (2). Chronic sinusitis was associated with the longest hospital stays (up to 26,841 days), while conditions like bacteremia showed no recorded hospital stay, indicating outpatient management.

Psychological stress was the most common condition across all age groups, with pregnancy-related conditions following closely. Middle-aged adults were particularly affected by psychological stress, while pregnancy-related conditions were common across all groups.

#### Encounter Data Insights
Encounters with problems were most often associated with nonspecific radiological findings and anemia, while pregnancy-related conditions and acute bronchitis were more common in ambulatory visits. This data highlighted significant patterns in healthcare interactions based on condition type and encounter class.

### Immunization Data Insights
Immunization trends showed a peak in 2021, with COVID-19 vaccines driving the highest volume, while 1946 had the lowest number of immunizations. There was a clear seasonal pattern in flu vaccinations, peaking in March and April, and showing a delayed trend in Massachusetts, likely due to the state's winter flu season (January to March). The Seasonal Flu Vaccine was the most frequently administered, followed by COVID-19 vaccines.

### Key Findings
* **Conditions:** Long stays were observed for conditions like Chronic Sinusitis, while bacteremia had no hospital stay.
* **Psychological stress** was most prevalent across all age groups, with pregnancy-related conditions second most common.
* **Vaccination:** A delayed flu vaccine trend was noted, with peaks in March and April.
* **Encounters:** Anemia and pregnancy-related conditions were commonly linked to hospital encounters and ambulatory visits.

### Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into healthcare trends, particularly the impact of COVID-19, seasonal vaccination patterns, and the healthcare burden of psychological stress. The findings emphasize the need for targeted vaccination strategies and optimized resource planning in response to fluctuating health conditions.

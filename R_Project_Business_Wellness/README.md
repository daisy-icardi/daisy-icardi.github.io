## **1. Project Overview**
This project aimed to analyse how individuals use non-Bellabeat smart devices to develop high-level marketing recommendations for Bellabeat. Urška Sršen, the co-founder of Bellabeat believes analyzing non-Bellabeat smart device usage data trends could provide meaningful insights into the potential marketing strategy of their health-focused smart products and thereby growth opportunities. 

### **1.1. Business Understanding: All about Bellabeat**
Bellabeat, co-founded in 2014 by Urška Sršen and Sando Muris is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women that has the potential to become a leading player in the global device market. Bellabeat offers personalized wellness solutions in-sync with womens' menstrual cycles to allow them to reach their fullest potential. 

The primary stakeholders designed a line of smart wellness products that utilise smart technology to track and collect biometric (e.g., heart-rate) plus lifestyle data (e.g., activity). This includes:
* **Leaf tracker**: Can be worn as a bracelet, necklace or clip. Tracks activity, sleep and stress.
* **Time watch**: Classic timepiece that tracks activity, sleep and stress.
* **Spring bottle**: Water bottle that tracks hydration levels.

This health information is collected and evaluated against menstrual cycle data, and mindfulness habits within the Bellabeat app designed. Technology-driven solutions are then delivered via the app to women based on the information collected to ensure healthy choices are made. As these devices are specifically engineered to be correlated with women's menstrual cycles, Urška Sršen and Sando Muris are largely considered pioneers in providing a movement towards designing products that offer a holistic, comprehensive and accurate approach to women's health experiences.

### **1.2. How the Project will be Addressed**
While there are many smart health-focused products offered by Bellabeat, the Bellabeat app was chosen for review as it is at the heart of the Bellabeat company, connected to the various smart wellness products. 

The business task will be addressed by answering the following questions:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage? 
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### **1.3. Data Understanding: All about the Data Sources**
The Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset, made public and available through Mobius, was utilised for the current investigation. It encompasses 18 CSV files with data from thirty eligible Fitbit users between the period of 2016-04-12 and 2016-05-12. Users consented to the collection of personal tracker data information including daily, hourly and minute-level data for physical activity, heart-rate as well as sleep and weight monitoring. 

### **1.4. Credibility of Data**
To check and determine credibility of the data source, the Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited (ROCCC) approach was employed. 
* **Reliability of data:** Reliability limited, with only 30 Fitbit Users included in the dataset. This sampling bias may lead to non-representative or non-meaningful conclusions for the population. Plus, there are some limitations with the datasets to which undermines the reliability of the data (examined further below, see 'Explored Key Tables' summary). 
* **Originallity:** Data was gathered by a third party (Amazon Mechanical Turk). As primary research was not gathered, it is of low originality. 
* **Comprehensive:** Data was reasonably comprehensive. Datasets included daily, hourly and minute-level data, to which is comprehensive for understanding the level of activity individuals were engaged in across days, hours and minutes. However, stress and mindfulness habits were not tracked and the datasets are limited in these respects especially as Bellabeat offers mindfulness and stress tracking. In addition, there was no demographic information collected regarding the participants. Nevertheless, it provides enough data to be within the parameters required for the task at hand. 
* **Current:** Data was sourced in 2016 (7 years ago). While it would be ideal to utlise the most current and dated datasets to elucidate current trends (data sourced within the past three years), the data was still gathered within the range of 10 years and may elucidate some potential trends. 
* **Cited:** The datasets were made available by Mobius on Kaggle and to the author's knowledge, have not been cited. 

Collectively, it is clear the data source would be considered of low quality. Therefore, the following analysis may only be able to highlight some preliminary directions that Bellabeat can take, to which should be verified through an analysis of a larger and much more reliable dataset.

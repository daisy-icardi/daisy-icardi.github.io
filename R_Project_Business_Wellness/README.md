## **Phase I: The Business Task**
The mission of the data analytics team, encompassing six members, is to analyse how individuals are using non-Bellabeat smart devices. 
Urška Sršen, the co-founder of Bellabeat believes analyzing non-Bellabeat smart device usage data trends could provide meaningful insights into the potential marketing strategy of their health-focused smart products and thereby growth opportunities. Consequently, it is expected high-level recommendations are drawn from analysing non-Bellabeat smart device usage. 

### **1.1. All about Bellabeat**
Bellabeat, co-founded in 2014 by Urška Sršen and Sando Muris is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women that has the potential to become a leading player in the global device market. Bellabeat offers personalized wellness solutions in-sync with womens' menstrual cycles to allow them to reach their fullest potential. 

The primary stakeholders designed a line of smart wellness products that utilise smart technology to track and collect biometric (e.g., heart-rate) plus lifestyle data (e.g., activity). This includes:
* **Leaf tracker**: Can be worn as a bracelet, necklace or clip. Tracks activity, sleep and stress.
* **Time watch**: Classic timepiece that tracks activity, sleep and stress.
* **Spring bottle**: Water bottle that tracks hydration levels.

This health information is collected and evaluated against menstrual cycle data, and mindfulness habits within the Bellabeat app designed. Technology-driven solutions are then delivered via the app to women based on the information collected to ensure healthy choices are made. As these devices are specifically engineered to be correlated with women's menstrual cycles, Urška Sršen and Sando Muris are largely considered pioneers in providing a movement towards designing products that offer a holistic, comprehensive and accurate approach to women's health experiences.

### **1.2. How the Business Task will be Addressed**
While there are many smart health-focused products offered by Bellabeat, the Bellabeat app was chosen for review as it is at the heart of the Bellabeat company, connected to the various smart wellness products. 

The business task will be addressed by answering the following questions:
1. What are some trends in smart devise usage? 
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
